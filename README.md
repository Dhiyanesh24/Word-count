# Word-count
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from a text.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1: Open the file in read mode and handle it in test moode.

### Step 2: Read the text using read() function.
 
### Step 3:  Split the text using space separator.We assume that words in a sentance are separted by a space character.

### Step 4:  The length of the split list should equal the numbers of words in the test file.

### Step 5: You can refine the count by cleaning the string prior to splitting or validating the words after splitting.

### Step 6: End the program.

       fname=input("enter the file name:")
       num_words=0
       with open(fname,'r') as f:
         for line in f:
          words=line.split()
          num_words+=len(words)
       print('Number of words:',num_words)
